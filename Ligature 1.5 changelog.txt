____________________________________________

New to 1.5 (in order of world-rockingness):
	- 	You can now hide text from the parser! Wrapping a block of text with (!))) ... (!)))
		(that's an opening bracket, a bang, and three closing brackets) will tell Ligature
		not to scan it for nouns, and not to autolink inside the excluded block. You can use
		this functionality to further protect HTML, or to add additional content like blog
		posts or credits or whatevs.
	-	Next and Previous navigation links have been added. You'll need to replace your
		control.php file and start using {PREV} and {NEXT} links in your story.htm template.
	-	The Table of Contents page (toc.php) now has a template tag option to sort stories
		by name (default) or by most recent.
	-	Display Name and Biography options were removed. New installations will not create
		them, and existing isntallations cannot access them. It was kind of useless, since
		Ligature is a single-user application and users often put those details on a
		separate page.
	-	The autolink handler now uses the nounlist that is on your server, not the one that
		is on mine. Whoops! You will be able to add or remove things to your list and have
		it actually do something.
	-	Autolink now does better when finding the target nouns to turn into links. Previously
		some nouns were missed if they occured at the start or end of a list.
	-	Appropriate form fields (Login and Add Noun, for example) now autofocus so you can
		start typing immediately.
	-	Autolink no longer looks for words after a forward slash (since this is probably a
		URL).
	-	Index page of Admin section now displays the site name (set with the meta-
		information in Preferences), which is useful if you run several installations of Ligature
		on one server.
	-	RSS feed now presents day of month correctly.
	-	Bug Report form now gives the right email subject line. Embarrassing.
	-	Some Preferences page options clarified.
	-	Exclude tag code (!)) added to The Punctuator.
